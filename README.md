## Getting Started

The principal rendering / view of the Specification is a [web page, `AMWA_AS_11_X3.html`](AMWA_AS_11_X3.html), that contains contextual links to other files in this repository.

## Specification Development and Implementation

Information on the further development and implementation of this and other AMWA AS-11 rules based Specifications are in a [separate GitHub project](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/AS-11_Overview/). Examples include:

* Issue tracking
* Sample MXF files

## Specification Change History

The full Specification history is available [here](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/AS-11_X3/commits). It is best to ignore changes to `AMWA_AS_11_X3.html` when examining the history of this repository (all the pertinent changes will be apparent in other files).
