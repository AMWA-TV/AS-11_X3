# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.



# Purpose of the AS-11 X3 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished HD inter-coded (Long GOP) TV Programmes (at frame rates of either 25p or 50p). It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

This Specification is formed of "Blocks" that naturally form a "tree". A rendering / view of this tree is shown below and is explained here.

## Entities Summary
The Specification-writing framework used to produce this Specification has several different types of component / entity. In summary:

* Each Specification is composed of a single Top-Level **Block (B)**
* Blocks are defined by containing **Artefacts (A)** or linking directly to other Blocks
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**

Each entity is identified by a unique URL.

Some of the letters in brackets above are used in the tree view to identify the type of each entity.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the Blocks / Artefacts from which it is constructed. "Informative" statements do not have to be complied with (details of "informative" statements are given below).

* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of an entity is considered "informative", as is its "description" (if present).
* "Note" entities are considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Some Artefacts are "data files" such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files. Some of these may be partially rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files.

_Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly._

## Parameter Blocks

There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:

* **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument")
* **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block (K)

                    [A] Byte 15 of the Header Partition Pack Key must be set to 04h and all Header Metadata must have correct values. Hence 'Distinguished Values' cannot be used for 'Best Effort' properties. See Section 6.2.3 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 for a full explanation.
                        
                        Late delivery of a file is the term used to describe a workflow where playout (broadcast) of a file starts before the file transfer from supplier to broadcaster has completed. To support late delivery a broadcaster must be able to trust the metadata that is contained at the beginning of the file.

                                Refer to SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 Section 6.2.1 for the "Partition Rules Overview"

                                There could be small segments of Essence under this regime. This would occur if, for example:
                                
                                * There is less than one minute of Essence in total. In this case there is a single Essence segment and this Essence segment is short (less than one minute).
                                * There is 30.5 minutes of Essence and Essence is being segmented every 10 minutes. In this case the final segment is only 30 seconds long.

                                The stated constraints mean that in each Index Table Segment a "Delta Entry Array" will be required. Additionally, if there is at least one <VBE> <Essence Element> in the <Essence Container> then an "Index Entry Array" could be required (the need for this will depend on, for example, whether <KLV Fill> padding has been used).

                                This Block allows a number of options regarding which Partition the Index Table Segments are located in. For example, they could be in their own dedicated Partition or in the same Partition as the next Essence Container segment (because in a Partition Index Table Segments always come before an Essence Container segment). The Index Table Segments will not necessarily be in the Partition that immediately follows the Essence Partition: there could be other Partitions in between (such as a Generic Stream Partition).
                                
                                # Index Table Repetition
                                
                                This Block places no constraint on Index Table Repetition. For example, a complete Index Table could additionally be included somewhere in the file if required.

                        [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
                            
                            The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.

                    [A] <SMPTE ST 381-3:2013> defines the AVC Sub Descriptor and states that it "should" be used. This Block places no additional constraints on the use of the AVC Sub Descriptor. Therefore, as far as this Block is concerned its use is regarded as optional but recommended. However, note that <SMPTE ST 381-3:2013> does mandate how the values of the AVC Sub Descriptor are populated -- for certain AVC streams it would not be possible to fulfil these requirements and so in such cases there is no choice but to omit the AVC Sub Descriptor.

                                * The `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` property of the {MCALabelSubDescriptor} is defined in SMPTE ST 377-4:2012 as having the type "ISO-8String". This type is undefined.
                                
                                * However, the entry for `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` in the SMPTE Elements Register correctly lists the type as "ISO7", which refers to "ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange.". That is the same character repertoire referenced by IETF RFC 5646.

                                Note that no constraint is placed on which "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels can be used in the file. The stated constraint simply means that implementations that comply with this Block must be able to support all of the specified Labels. In practice this means that for most real Sound Tracks the specified Labels ought to be used but alternative Labels can be used if the need arises (for example to support the delivery of additional specialist Sound Tracks for which Labels have been privately agreed between the supplier and the broadcaster).

                        [A] # Use of Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage
                            
                            The file can use Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage to carry audio presentation metadata for zero, one or more than one SoundfieldGroups / Audio Programs.
                            
                            # SDID value
                            
                            SMPTE ST 2020-1 specifies that the SDID value within the VANC Data Packet be used to identify the Sound Tracks that make up the Audio Program. For example, VANC Data Packets that contain Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream for a 5.1 channel Audio Program starting at channel pair 5/6 will require the SDID value in the VANC Data Packet to be set to 04h.
                            
                            However, this approach only works inside an MXF file if every Audio Channel in the file is identifiable using a pan-file channel number. This is the case if, for example, the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are numbered mono Sound Tracks.
                            
                            However, if the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are Multichannel Sound Tracks then this approach does not work. Some consequences of this:
                            
                            * The value to be used for SDID is undefined.
                            * If more than one 5.1 SoundfieldGroup (and at least one Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream) is included in the file then an external mechanism is needed to relate SoundfieldGroups and Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams.
                            * The SDID values might need to be rewritten upon output so that they correctly identify the Audio Channels that are being used to carry the relevant SoundfieldGroup / Audio Program. For example, this might be the case when playing out an MXF file to SDI -- particularly if only certain audio is played out or the audio layout is changed.
                            
                            # DID value
                            
                            VANC Data Packets that are carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream will have a DID value of 45h.
                            
                            # Packets are not constant throughout
                            
                            SMPTE 2020-B requires that there is "one packet in each field of interlaced video formats". However, the two packets in each interlaced video frame are not identical.
                            
                            The values of SMPTE RDD 6 metadata properties might change from one frame to the next, but normally they will not. However, the VANC Data Packets in the file will not be identical even if the metadata is static: the "frame_count" will certainly increment and the "description_text" (if not null) will change.
                            
                            # Other data being carried in the ANC Frame Element
                            
                            The ANC Frame Element can also contain HANC Data Packets and other VANC Data Packets in addition to those carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams. Irrespective of what data is carried in the ANC Frame Element, there is only ever one Track (in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package), one Data Element, and one associated Essence Descriptor in the MXF file.

                [A] The MCA Tag Symbols for labels that are used here but defined elsewhere have had prefixes applied to the values specified in their defining documents.
                    
                    These prefixes (`ch` for Audio Channel; `sg` for Soundfield Group; `gg` for Group of Soundfield Group) are also applied by the Digital Cinema and IMF applications of the Multichannel Audio Labeling framework (SMPTE ST 377-4), so this Specification uses the same MCA Tag Symbols as used in those applications.

                    Other valid combinations of "Soundfield Group" and "Group of Soundfield Groups" Labels are also possible.

                    [N] Implementation Notes
                        <URL: http://vm-1274-user.virt.ch.bbc.co.uk/as/note/E28/>
                        [A] All of the Sound Tracks defined by this Default Audio Layout are optional, so there could be zero Sound Tracks.
                            
                            Sound Tracks in this Default Audio Layout are identified by the order in which they appear.
                            
                            So, if you are using this Layout and want to deliver 5.1 Main Programme only (with no Stereo Main Programme) then your file will have to include two tracks, like so:
                            
                            * first Sound Track: 2-channel (silence is advised)
                            * second Sound Track: 6-channel (5.1 Main Programme content)
                            
                            No mechanism is provided here for signaling that the first Sound Track does not actually contain Stereo Main Programme.
