# **[Work In Progress]** AS-11 X3 (MXF Program Contribution - HD Long GOP (25p, 50p))

_This file is one rendering / view of this AMWA Specification and is a part of the Specification repository. Visit the AMWA [web page for this Specification](http://amwa.tv/projects/AS-11-X3.shtml) which has information about revisions and current development._


# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.


# Purpose of the AS-11 X3 Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished HD inter-coded (Long GOP) TV Programmes (at frame rates of either 25p or 50p). It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

## The Rules-Based Specification Framework
This Specification has been written using a 'Rules-based Specification Framework'. In this framework, each 'constraint' or 'rule' is expressed as a 'Component' which can be unambiguosly identified by its ID (which is a URL). These Components assemble into 'networks' or 'webs' to form complete Specifications, with many Components being re-used across a number of Specifications. Through this approach machine processable Specifications are developed which are less ambiguous and easier to implement and test.

* **Blocks (B)** are the fundamental 'building bricks' of a Specification -- they provide its _structure_.
* A Block can either link to **Artefacts (A)** that it 'owns' or link to other Blocks.
* Artefacts provide the real _content_ of a Specification. They may contain textual statements, code excerpts, or tables, for example.
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks.
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**.
* There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:
  * **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument").
  * **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block.

In this document the network of Blocks (and other Components) that form the Specification are shown as a 'tree': the Specification Blocks Tree. The letters in brackets above are used in the tree to identify the different kinds of Component.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with this Specification if it complies with the Components from which it is constructed, as shown in the Specification Blocks Tree, subject to the following provisions:

* An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the normative Components from which it is constructed. "Informative" items (as defined below) do not have to be complied with.
* "Note" Components are considered "informative". All other Components are considered "normative" unless otherwise noted.
* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of a Component is considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Other Artefacts are "data files" (such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files). Some of these may be _partially_ rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files -- links are provided to such data files in the Specification Blocks Tree.
* Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly.

                                Refer to SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 Section 6.2.1 for the "Partition Rules Overview"
                                
                                # Small segments
                                
                                There could be small segments of Essence under this regime. This would occur if, for example:
                                
                                * There is less than one minute of Essence in total. In this case there is a single Essence segment and this Essence segment is short (less than one minute).
                                * There is 30.5 minutes of Essence and Essence is being segmented every 10 minutes. In this case the final segment is only 30 seconds long.

                                The stated constraints mean that in each Index Table Segment a "Delta Entry Array" will be required. Additionally, if there is at least one <VBE> <Essence Element> in the <Essence Container> then an "Index Entry Array" could be required (the need for this will depend on, for example, whether <KLV Fill> padding has been used).
                                
                                # Partitions
                                
                                This Block allows a number of options regarding which Partition the Index Table Segments are located in. For example, they could be in their own dedicated Partition or in the same Partition as the next Essence Container segment (because in a Partition Index Table Segments always come before an Essence Container segment). The Index Table Segments will not necessarily be in the Partition that immediately follows the Essence Partition: there could be other Partitions in between (such as a Generic Stream Partition).
                                
                                # Index Table Repetition
                                
                                This Block places no constraint on Index Table Repetition. For example, a complete Index Table could additionally be included somewhere in the file if required.

                        [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
                            
                            The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.

                [N] Use of the AVC Sub Descriptor
                    <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E11/>
                    [A] <SMPTE ST 381-3:2013> defines the AVC Sub Descriptor and states that it "should" be used. This Block places no additional constraints on the use of the AVC Sub Descriptor. Therefore, as far as this Block is concerned its use is regarded as optional but recommended. However, note that <SMPTE ST 381-3:2013> does mandate how the values of the AVC Sub Descriptor are populated -- for certain AVC streams it would not be possible to fulfil these requirements and so in such cases there is no choice but to omit the AVC Sub Descriptor.

                    [A] ST 381-3:2011 states:

                                        <SoundfieldGroupLabelSubDescriptor>s and <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s could all be on one <Sound Track> or distributed. Hence, even the <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor>s might not be on the same <Sound Track>.
                                        
                                        If several <Soundfield Group>s reference a single <Group of Soundfield Groups> then there will be more than one <GroupOfSoundfieldGroupsLabelSubDescriptor> for that <Group of Soundfield Groups>. That is, it is repeated for each <Soundfield Group> that references it.
                                        
                                        
                                        # Type of RFC5646SpokenLanguage property
                                        
                                        The value of this property is encoded as a US-ASCII string with one byte per character.
                                        
                                        Details:
                                        
                                        * The `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` property of the {MCALabelSubDescriptor} is defined in SMPTE ST 377-4:2012 as having the type "ISO-8String". This type is undefined.
                                        
                                        * However, the entry for `RFC5646SpokenLanguage` in the SMPTE Elements Register correctly lists the type as "ISO7", which refers to "ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange.". That is the same character repertoire referenced by IETF RFC 5646.

                        Note that no constraint is placed on which "MCA Label Dictionary ID" Labels can be used in the file. The stated constraint simply means that implementations that comply with this Block must be able to support all of the specified Labels. In practice this means that for most real Sound Tracks the specified Labels ought to be used but alternative Labels can be used if the need arises (for example to support the delivery of additional specialist Sound Tracks for which Labels have been privately agreed between the supplier and the broadcaster).

                        [A] ## XML Document size limits
                            The constraints mean that Byte 6 of the two set keys will be 53h. The amount of text data must be equal to or less than 65535 bytes.
                            
                            ## Amendment
                            A crucial amendment to ST 2057 exists and must be read carefully -- it changes the ULs of various keys used in the Standard.

                        [A] # Use of Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage
                            
                            The file can use Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage to carry audio presentation metadata for zero, one or more than one SoundfieldGroups / Audio Programs.
                            
                            # SDID value
                            
                            SMPTE ST 2020-1 specifies that the SDID value within the VANC Data Packet be used to identify the Sound Tracks that make up the Audio Program. For example, VANC Data Packets that contain Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream for a 5.1 channel Audio Program starting at channel pair 5/6 will require the SDID value in the VANC Data Packet to be set to 04h.
                            
                            However, this approach only works inside an MXF file if every Audio Channel in the file is identifiable using a pan-file channel number. This is the case if, for example, the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are numbered mono Sound Tracks.
                            
                            However, if the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are Multichannel Sound Tracks then this approach does not work. Some consequences of this:
                            
                            * The value to be used for SDID is undefined.
                            * If more than one 5.1 SoundfieldGroup (and at least one Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream) is included in the file then an external mechanism is needed to relate SoundfieldGroups and Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams.
                            * The SDID values might need to be rewritten upon output so that they correctly identify the Audio Channels that are being used to carry the relevant SoundfieldGroup / Audio Program. For example, this might be the case when playing out an MXF file to SDI -- particularly if only certain audio is played out or the audio layout is changed.
                            
                            # DID value
                            
                            VANC Data Packets that are carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream will have a DID value of 45h.
                            
                            # Packets are not constant throughout
                            
                            SMPTE 2020-B requires that there is "one packet in each field of interlaced video formats". However, the two packets in each interlaced video frame are not identical.
                            
                            The values of SMPTE RDD 6 metadata properties might change from one frame to the next, but normally they will not. However, the VANC Data Packets in the file will not be identical even if the metadata is static: the "frame_count" will certainly increment and the "description_text" (if not null) will change.
                            
                            # Other data being carried in the ANC Frame Element
                            
                            The ANC Frame Element can also contain HANC Data Packets and other VANC Data Packets in addition to those carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams. Irrespective of what data is carried in the ANC Frame Element, there is only ever one Track (in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package), one Data Element, and one associated Essence Descriptor in the MXF file.

                        When making comparisons of these values, it is insufficient to simply compare each of the numerators and each of the denominators. For example, `7/5` is mathematically equal to `14/10`.

                <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E26/>
                [A] The MCA Tag Symbols for labels that are used here but defined elsewhere have had prefixes applied to the values specified in their defining documents.
                    
                    These prefixes (`ch` for Audio Channel; `sg` for Soundfield Group; `gg` for Group of Soundfield Group) are also applied by the Digital Cinema and IMF applications of the Multichannel Audio Labeling framework (SMPTE ST 377-4), so this Specification uses the same MCA Tag Symbols as used in those applications.

            [N] Labeling Audio Description
                <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E32/>
                [A] The anticipated application of these Labels to "Audio Decsription" is as follows:
                    
                    * `AudioDescription` will be used with `AudioDescriptionStudioSignal`
                    * `AudioDescriptionProgramMix` will be used with `SMPTEST20678StandardStereo`
                    
                    Other valid combinations of "Soundfield Group" and "Group of Soundfield Groups" Labels are also possible.

            [N] Unused Audio Labelling
                <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E80/>
                [A] The "Unused Audio" label is expected to be used when channels are part of a fixed audio layout but are not used for the program or associated content. The Audio Channel and Soundfield Group labels are still used to label the physical properties of the unused audio, but the Soundfield Group references the "Unused Audio" Group Of Soundfield Groups label to indicate the channels are unused.

                            [N] Implementation Notes
                                <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E28/>
                                [A] All of the Sound Tracks defined by this Default Audio Layout are optional, so there could be zero Sound Tracks.
                                    
                                    Sound Tracks in this Default Audio Layout are identified by the order in which they appear.
                                    
                                    So, if you are using this Layout and want to deliver 5.1 Main Programme only (with no Stereo Main Programme) then your file will have to include two tracks, like so:
                                    
                                    * first Sound Track: 2-channel (silence is advised)
                                    * second Sound Track: 6-channel (5.1 Main Programme content)
                                    
                                    No mechanism is provided here for signaling that the first Sound Track does not actually contain Stereo Main Programme.

                            [N] Implementation Notes
                                <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E28/>
                                [A] All of the Sound Tracks defined by this Default Audio Layout are optional, so there could be zero Sound Tracks.
                                    
                                    Sound Tracks in this Default Audio Layout are identified by the order in which they appear.
                                    
                                    So, if you are using this Layout and want to deliver 5.1 Main Programme only (with no Stereo Main Programme) then your file will have to include two tracks, like so:
                                    
                                    * first Sound Track: 2-channel (silence is advised)
                                    * second Sound Track: 6-channel (5.1 Main Programme content)
                                    
                                    No mechanism is provided here for signaling that the first Sound Track does not actually contain Stereo Main Programme.

    [N] Audio Layout Modes summary
        <URL: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E14/>
        [A] A summary of the {Audio Layout Mode}s available in this Specification is in the table below. Note that every MXF file must use one of the listed modes.
            
            In all defined modes there can be between 0 and 127 (inclusive) Sound Tracks in the MXF file.
            
            Mode Name           | "Channel Assignment Label"                                                 | "MCA Labeling Present"  |     "Default Audio Layout"
            ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------
            Audio Layout Mode 0 | ConstrainedMultichannelAudioLabelingFramework                              |          true           | **NOT SET** (no assumptions can be made)
            Audio Layout Mode 1 | ConstrainedMultichannelAudioLabelingFramework_with_Default_Audio_Layout_A  |          true           | Default Audio Layout 'A'
            Audio Layout Mode 2 | Default_Audio_Layout_A_without_MCA_Labeling	                             |          false          | Default Audio Layout 'A'
